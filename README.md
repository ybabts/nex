# What is Nex?

*Have you ever had to roll back your database? Well you can't back up your database every single time you write to it... or could you?*

Nex is an event sourced graph database designed to never lose data and provide new ways to connect historical information to the nodes and relationships in your database. It stores every change and operation in the database along with timestamps, source, and more. Truely it is a database on crack for crackheads.

# Is it done?

Currently Nex is a work in progress, if you would like to contribute please feel free to create a pull request or contact me.
